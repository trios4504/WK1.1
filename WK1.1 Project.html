    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and almost all webpages and user interfaces written with HTML use it. CSS is a style sheet language that adds styling and formatting to documents written in a markup language.</p>

    <p>Currently in its third version (often referred to as CSS3), CSS adds presentation to a web page whereas HTML creates the page structure.</p>
        
    <p>There are different ways to incorporate CSS into your HTML page, but the most common would be through an external stylesheet using a .css file extension. (This external stylesheet is the most preferred, for it is much more efficient when it comes to making changes.)</p>
        
    <p>However, there are other methods to include CSS styles, such as internally (style defined at top of HTML page) and inline (so adding the style right to the specific HTML tag.)</p>
        
    <p>CSS is perfect for anyone wanting to build their own site. Or someone looking to become a developer or designer. Really, for anyone who is looking to learn website basics, CSS is a great place to start.</p>
